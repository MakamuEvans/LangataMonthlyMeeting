                                Friends Church (Quakers) Langata Monthly Meeting started in 1987. <br>
                                It has three local meetings which are located as below; <br><br>

                                1. <b class="theme-l">Langata Local Church</b> -located near Otiende Shopping Centre,
                                opposite Langata High School and is less than one kilometer from Langata Police Station.
                                The church started in 1987 as a local meeting by a handful of members of Quaker faith
                                meeting at the KWS education center and later at the Langata Road Primary School. As the
                                congregation grew the members acquired a one acre plot where current construction is
                                ongoing. It has a seating capacity of 2,500 people. To date through the members own
                                efforts and other friends and well wishers we have managed to complete construction of
                                the foundation, walling, ring beams, balcony, roofing, doors, plastering, tiling the
                                floor and offices.<br><br>

                                2. <b class="theme-l">Nairobi West Local Church</b> -located next to Strathmore Business
                                School in Nairobi West. The church is in a developmental phase and is working on
                                development of the plot to accommodate various church activities.<br><br>

                                3. <b class="theme-l">Ongata Rongai Local Church</b> -is located in Ongata Rongai near
                                Tuskys Chap Chap across Magadi Road third right turning on land that was purchased in
                                2012. The Church was inaugurated by the Nairobi Yearly Meeting as a local meeting of the
                                Langata Monthly Meeting in 2011 and have been meeting in over four different rented
                                locations before finally identifying a piece of land to purchase where they currently
                                meet. To date through the members own efforts and other friends and well-wishers the
                                Church has managed to build a temporary meeting room, ablution facilities.<br><br>

                                Our desire is to grow in Christ and to preach to all in our community, family and
                                friends about the love of Christ.
